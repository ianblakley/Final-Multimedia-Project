          <h2>What's going on with Austin's housing?</h2>
          <p>
            Austin's housing market has been getting far more expensive over the
            past five years. The large groups of people moving in to Austin,
            coupled with the limited housing availability in the area has
            created a disaster for lower income residents, who are now being
            priced out of their own homes.
          </p>
          <h2>What caused this issue?</h2>
          <p>
            According to an article from The Real Deal, a Texas real estate news
            website, "The city’s severe housing shortage is largely to blame.
            Housing experts say a stable housing market is when neither the
            buyer or the seller have the upper hand in negotiations. That’s
            typically defined as six to six-and-a-half months of inventory,
            meaning it would take that long before all available homes were sold
            if no others became available in that time." (source). As stated
            earlier, the problem has stemmed from a lack of inventory that has
            been pushed to its limits by a drastic increase in Austin's
            population.
          </p>
          <h2>How this affects Austin residents</h2>
          <p>
            Edgar Sandoval from the New York Times wrote an article interviewing
            certain long=time Austin residents who have observed the change in
            the housing market in recent years. Sandoval also highlights the
            ongoing gentrification happening in Austin. "Nearby, another
            apartment complex now sits on land once occupied by a historical
            Black church. Another Black church, built in the 1860s, was
            demolished to make way for a road to accommodate all the new
            traffic. And a neighborhood hair salon was replaced with a trendy
            South American bakery. 'This has become the tale of two Austins,'
            said Susana Almanza, a longtime activist. 'The rich keep building in
            our neighborhoods and the poor keep getting displaced. It doesn’t
            end.'" (source).
          </p>
          <h2>What can be done about this?</h2>
          <p>A few possible solutions for this problem are utlizing city policy
          to allow for denser housing, </p>
